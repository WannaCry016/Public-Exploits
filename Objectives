Public Exploits Reversing
Sprint 1 (4 Weeks): Study and implementation of following CVEs
CVE-2017-11882
CVE-2023-38831
CVE-2024-21413
CVE-2017-8570 [Use case of deploying cobalt strike beacon][1].

Sprint 2 (2 Weeks): AV evasion techniques to make the CVEs undetectable.

Sprint 3 (3 Weeks): Study the recent CVEs from here and look for the public exploits and replicate the same in controlled environments for purple teaming. The focus should be on the server softwares such as apache, Ngnix, nodejs or the frameworks such as wordpress or the common utility softwares such as MS office suite.
Test available PoCs of CVEs against different configs of OS and AVs
Continually experiment for making the exploits undetectable under specific OS and AV versions.
